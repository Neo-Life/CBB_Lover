# [Crystal Blue Bloom](https://astrbot.tech)

Where frost congeals in silent places, deep blue whispers of the faint and slight;  
Not velvet-soft, nor blazing with fierce light.  
Its edge like an old, half-kept vow, as pure as the heart’s inner gate;  
A prism lets star-sparks through, rousing the dream’s soft state.  
Shattered shadows cleave the long night — peerless beauty rises now;  
Blue crystal blooms alone, its lucid sheen reflected on the glass.

A discarded concept from the AstrBot landing page, too beautiful to be deployed.
